        <h2>My Storytelling Journey</h2>

        <p>
          Coming originally from a STEM background, I’ve learned to combine the creative with the analytical in what I believe is a balanced approach that defines how I see storytelling today. I first discovered my passion for the craft while studying at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which led me to continue my education at the University of Connecticut’s Digital Media & Design program. Between both experiences, I’ve learned to think creatively and strategically about how stories are made and shared with audiences. Diversity of perspective has been my biggest teacher and continues to guide how I approach my work.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to keep telling stories that reach and resonate with audiences — whether through film, writing, design, or other digital media projects. I want to help create work that connects people, sparks emotion, and reflects the many ways we experience the world — stories that people see themselves in, that make them feel understood, or that offer a new way of looking at the world.

 <!-- WORKING SCROLL BUTTON
    This little JS chunk basically handles my “scroll down” button. 
    When I click the button, it looks at the data-scroll-target attribute 
    (which is just pointing to the #about section), and then it smoothly 
    scrolls the page down to that spot. AI helped me figure out the logic 
    and clean formatting for this. -->
  <script>
    document.querySelectorAll("[data-scroll-target]").forEach(btn => {
      btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
        const target = btn.getAttribute("data-scroll-target");
        document.querySelector(target).scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" });
      });
    });
  </script>

</body>
